# RETROSPECTIVES
Think about the following topics:
* On a scale of 1â€“10, how do you feel this sprint went? Why?
* If you could go back in time and do this sprint again, what would you change and what wouldn't you change?
* What about this sprint was the biggest source of stress or difficulty for you personally?
* How did you cope as a team with things that went wrong?
* What was the effect of earlier retrospectives?
* Are there aspects of our team culture that can be improved?

## First Retrospective [4-10-2024]
* what went well?
    The project started smoothly. I added a feedback column to my Scrum board, which was very well-received, which helped create a positive start.
## seconde Retrospective [11-10-2024]
* what went well?

I started over from scratch. Initially, I was coding everything from the ground up, but this time, I downloaded a template and built around it. This made it easier to get started, as I was getting stuck on tasks that should normally only take about 10 minutes. Starting over turned out to be a good decision because I am now further along than I was before. For some parts, I kept my own code instead of using the template's version because I felt my approach was much better.

I made a lot of progress and am almost finished. I just need to do some polishing.
